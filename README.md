famous-demos
============

This is the code for some of the stuff I demoed in a recent devshop talk.

## NOTE:

The famous library is obfuscated. Because it's a newer codebase than the one I
use in the demos, there are some issues that I'm currently sorting out with
Famo.us. Namely, in the todos app, it appears that Meteor's event handlers 
aren't always getting hooked up. Hit refresh on the page several times to work
around this. The todos app look pretty funny - you'll see why :)
